# Traffic Analysis

### Forensics Cyber-Security - Lab 3

This assignment aims to improve your skills on traffic analysis. It is divided into two groups of exercises. 

In the first group, you have to analyze two network traces using a conventional packet analyzer, e.g., Wireshark, and answer a few questions about the collected traffic. 

In the second group, you will be exposed to advanced network forensic techniques, namely for website fingerprinting over the Tor network.
